# STATIC DEVELOPER PORTFOLIO WEBSITE

This project is submitted as **Task 1** of my internship, where I was instructed to **develop a static portfolio website** for a developer using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. The website is fully static — no database or backend — and focuses on **clean design, responsiveness**, and showcasing **skills and projects**.

---

##  Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – for semantic structure of the web pages  
- **CSS3** – for layout, styling, responsiveness, and animations  
- **JavaScript** – for interactivity (like modals and skill toggles)  
- **Bootstrap Icons (PNG)** – used for professional UI icons  
- **Google Fonts** – to improve the look and readability of text

---

##  Objective

The goal was to create a **responsive, user-friendly portfolio** that presents the developer's:

- **Profile and Introduction**
- **Skills and Technologies**
- **Projects with Images and Descriptions**
- **Contact Information**
- **Form to connect** (static only; no backend handling)

---

##  Folder Structure
index.html(home page with sections : about-skills,projects,contac)
   it contains a button for the user asking if they got a project whic redirects them to
    form.html
    after submittion
       thankyou.html(gives a thankyou message for submittion and a button that redirects to the home page)
css-style.css
js-script.js
images-profilepic.png(Developers photo)
icons-html,css,js,bootstrap(skill icons)


---

##  Description of Sections

###  Home (index.html)
The landing page includes a **hero section** with a short introduction, profile image, and action buttons like "Download Resume" and "Got a Project".

###  About Me + Skills
Describes the developer’s background and a button to toggle their **technical skillset**, displayed using icon images.

###  Projects
A list of 2–3 sample projects shown as cards. Each has an image, a short description, and a "More Details" button that opens a **JavaScript modal** for extended information.

### ✉️ Contact
Icons link to GitHub, LinkedIn, and email. There's also a static form **form.html** that redirects to **thankyou.html** after submission using html <form action="thankyou.html method="get"> 


---

##  Responsiveness
The website is fully responsive:
Uses flexbox and media queries to adapt layout
Looks great on desktops, tablets, and mobile phones
Button sizes, images, and font sizes adjust on smaller screens
The layout adapts fluidly to various screen resolutions, ensuring a smooth experience regardless of the device. This is especially useful for recruiters or clients viewing the portfolio from mobile devices.
